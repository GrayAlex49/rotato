# Rotato Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and customize for your setup

global:
  # How often to rotate wallpapers (in minutes)
  rotation_interval_minutes: 10

  # Cache file to store image metadata (speeds up scanning)
  cache_file: image_cache.json

  # Maximum directory recursion depth when scanning
  max_recursion_depth: 10

  # Supported image formats
  supported_formats:
    - .jpg
    - .jpeg
    - .png
    - .webp
    - .bmp

  # Global hotkeys (Windows keyboard shortcuts)
  hotkeys:
    # Manually trigger wallpaper rotation
    trigger_rotation: ctrl+alt+w

    # Open current wallpaper in File Explorer
    open_current_image: ctrl+alt+o

# Monitor configurations
# You can have multiple monitor configurations with different settings
monitors:
  # Configuration 1: Auto (applies to all monitors)
  - monitor_name: auto  # 'auto' means any/all monitors

    # Image source directories or files
    # You can list multiple paths
    image_sources:
      - C:/Users/YourName/Pictures/Wallpapers
      - D:/Photos/Nature
      # - /path/to/specific/image.jpg

    # Recursively scan subdirectories
    recursive: true

    # Rotation interval for this monitor (overrides global setting)
    rotation_interval_minutes: 10

    # Filtering options - remove or comment out filters you don't need
    filters:
      # Resolution filters (in pixels)
      min_width: 1920
      min_height: 1080
      # max_width: 3840
      # max_height: 2160

      # Aspect ratio filters
      # Common ratios: 1.78 (16:9), 2.33 (21:9), 1.6 (16:10), 0.56 (9:16 vertical)
      aspect_ratios: [1.78]  # Only 16:9 images
      aspect_ratio_tolerance: 0.1  # ±10% tolerance

      # Brightness filter (0-255, average RGB brightness)
      # Useful to avoid too dark or too bright images
      brightness_range: [50, 200]

      # File size limit (in megabytes)
      max_file_size_mb: 20

  # Configuration 2: Example for specific monitor
  # Uncomment and customize if you have multiple monitors with different needs
  # - monitor_name: \\\\.\\DISPLAY1  # Windows monitor device name
  #   image_sources:
  #     - C:/Users/YourName/Pictures/Vertical
  #   recursive: true
  #   rotation_interval_minutes: 15
  #   filters:
  #     min_width: 1080
  #     min_height: 1920
  #     aspect_ratios: [0.56]  # 9:16 for vertical monitors
  #     aspect_ratio_tolerance: 0.1

# Tips:
# 1. To find your monitor device names, run Rotato and check the console output
# 2. Use forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\) in Windows paths
# 3. Set rotation_interval_minutes to a large number (e.g., 1440) for daily rotation
# 4. Remove filters you don't need - they're all optional
# 5. Use the hotkey (default: Ctrl+Alt+W) to test rotation immediately
